## Monetary Policy Statements

- "The Reserve Bank publishes its Monetary Policy Statement (MPS) quarterly. Each Monetary Policy Statement must set out:

  - how the Reserve Bank proposes to achieve its targets;

  - how it proposes to formulate and implement monetary policy during the next five years; and

  - how monetary policy has been implemented since the last Monetary Policy Statement."

## Official Cash Rate

- The Reserve Bank uses monetary policy to maintain price stability as defined in the Policy Targets Agreement (PTA). The current PTA requires the Bank to keep inflation between 1 and 3 percent on average over the medium term, with a focus on keeping future average inflation near the 2 percent target midpoint. The Bank implements monetary policy by setting the Official Cash Rate (OCR), which is reviewed eight times a year.
